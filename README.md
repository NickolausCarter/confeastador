## Description of Typical Work Flow

A consumer using an application to make reservations for their favorite restaurant.
When I first load the app, I am taken to the home page.</br>
On the home page, I see a description of what the app is as well as an option to create an account or login.</br>
When I click create an account, I am prompted to enter my name, email and a password. </br>
If I already have an account, I can sign in with my email and password. </br>
On the home page, I’ll have a header that links to the following pages - Search, Saved Reservations and Account. </br>
From the search page, I can select a cuisine</br>
Once I’ve selected my cuisine, I am presented with a list of restaurants in Austin, Texas. (We can choose any city)</br>
The list of restaurants will display information such as: Name of restaurant, Address, Rating, Expense ratio (example: $$)</br>
When I select a restaurant, I am presented with a calendar of available reservation dates and times.</br>
Once I have selected my date & time, I am asked how many people will be in my party.</br>
I can save my reservation and then view it under Saved Reservations page.</br> 
The saved reservations page will display all reservations I have made.</br> 
From the saved reservations page, I can edit or delete a reservation.</br>
