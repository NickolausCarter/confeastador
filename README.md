- Solidified further understanding of Mongodb, Mongoose and Express.js
- Designing an application from scratch using Create React App

## Description of Typical Work Flow

A consumer using an application to make reservations for their favorite restaurant.</br>
When I first load the app, I am taken to the home page.</br>
On the home page, I see a description of what the app is as well as an option to create an account or login.</br>
When I click create an account, I am prompted to enter my name, email and a password. </br>
If I already have an account, I can sign in with my email and password. </br>
On the home page, I can see saved reservations, search restaurants, or logout. </br>
I can search for restaurants by zip code or just click search with an empty search field to see all restaurants.</br>
The list of restaurants will display the restaurant name, type of cuisine, and zip code</br>
When I select a restaurant, I am presented with a calendar of available reservation dates and times.</br>
I can save my reservation and view it from the home page.</br>
I can see all the reservations I currently have and can edit or delete reservations.</br>
